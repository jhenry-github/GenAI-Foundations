The Tree Index allows you to build a hierarchical structure, where documents are segmented into chunks, and each chunk is stored as a node in a tree. This allows you to retrieve documents while keeping the context (the spot in the hierarchy where the data appeared). By contrast, LangChain operates on a flat structure."
