It may be \\nthat across the immensity of space the Martians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer \\nsettlement.

It may be that in \\nthe larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not  without its ultimate \\nbenefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene conf idence in the future which is the most \\nfruitful source of decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and \\nit has done much to promote th e conception of the commonweal of mankind. It may be \\nthat across the immensity of space the Martians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer \\nsettlement. Be that as it may, for many year s yet there will certainly be no relaxation of \\nthe eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and thos e fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, \\nwill bring with them as they fall an unavoida ble apprehension to all the sons of men.\\n\\nand the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer;  they rise upon me ta ttered and dog-bitten. \\nThey gibber and grow fiercer, paler, uglier, mad distortions of huma nity at last, and I \\nwake, cold and wretched, in the darkness of the night.\\n\\nBut the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the swift death flying \\nyonder, not two miles away. There was a noise  of business from the gasworks, and the \\nelectric lamps were all alight. I stopped at the group of people.  \\n   \"What news from the common?\" said I.  \\n   There were two men and a woman at the gate.  \\n   \"Eh?\" said one of the men, turning.     \"What news from the common?\" I said.  \\n   \"\\'Ain\\'t yer just BEEN there?\" asked the men.  \\n   \"People seem fair silly about the common,\" said the woman over the gate. \"What\\'s it all \\nabart?\"  \\n   \"Haven\\'t you heard of the men from Mars ?\" said I; \"the creatures from Mars?\"  \\n   \"Quite enough,\" said the woman over the gate. \"Thenks\"; and all three of them laughed.  \\n   I felt foolish and angry. I tried and found I could not tell them what I had seen. They \\nlaughed again at my broken sentences.     \"You\\'ll hear more yet,\" I said, and went on to my home.\\n\\nQuestion: What did the Martian rockets look like?\\nHelpful Answer:'\n",
